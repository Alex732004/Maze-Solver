# Maze-Solver
A maze is a network of paths, some leading to the end node, some not. The idea was to use a computer to generate 
a maze represented by a graph. There are dead ends and there are many different paths that branch off into many different 
possibilities in a maze. The maze is represented by a network of paths since many different possibilities can branch off from 
a single decision. Using a graph it is possible to generate many different possible paths and find a single possible path that can 
solve the maze. The star point will be a node and the end of the maze will be another node. The program various graph methods and
algorithms to compute and draw out graphs for the algorithm to solve.
You can choose the size of the maze. 

Instructions:
After running main.py, you may navigate the maze using arrow keys (←, →, ↑, ↓). Your goal is to get from the
top left corner to the bottom right corner. There is guaranteed to be a path to the end of the maze. If you give up
and want to see the computer animate the shortest path you can take to solve the maze, press the spacebar. Note that
once you solve the maze, you cannot see the shortest path. Once you press the spacebar, you cannot attempt to solve
the maze anymore.
